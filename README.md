# Sandbox
A trivial application that demonstrates Kotlin's variables, constants, and types. This exercise is based on Kotlin Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide. The main branch is the base app, challenge exercises are implemented in the branches.

## What I learned
- Creating a Kotlin/JVM project
- Types
- - Built-in data types (Booleans, Characters, Strings, etc)
- - Variables (var), run-time constants (val) and compile-time constants (const val)
- - Inspecting Kotlin bytecode
